# IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection-Project

## Description
This project is a part of the Machine Learning Course provided by Upskill Income Sharing Agreement program with Intelligent Machines. 
In this competition, different machine learning models were benchmarked on a challenging large-scale dataset. The data contains real-world e-commerce transactions from Vesta. It contains a wide range of features from device type to product features. The competitors were to develop a machine learning model to predict if the transaction is fraud or not fraud. This project targets to improve the efficacy of fraudulent transaction alerts for millions of people around the world, helping hundreds of thousands of businesses reduce their fraud loss and increase their revenue

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Programming language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBClassifier
Environment: Kaggle Notebook

### Executing program

* Go to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to run jupyter notebooks if it fails to open on Github
* Copy and Paste the URL of the .ipynb file in the blank of the nbviewer: https://github.com/Abrar2652/IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection-Project/blob/main/ieee-cis-fraud-detection.ipynb

## Help

If you face difficulties running the model on your local machine or Google Colab Notebook, then check if you are running the Kernel on CPU or GPU. If you're running on CPU, change the runtime to GPU. I ran this notebook with 4 GB RAM, 2.4 GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU. I faced a lot of difficulties including sudden shutdown duw to overheating, running out of my resources, etc. Kaggle environment worked well for me.
